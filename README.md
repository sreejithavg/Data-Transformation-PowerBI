# Data-Transformation-PowerBI


### Project Description

The Data-Transformation-PowerBI project demonstrates using Microsoft Power BI to clean and transform raw data into a more structured and usable format. The primary goal of this project is to take a given dataset, process it using Power BI's built-in data transformation tools, and generate meaningful insights through clean and well-structured data.

In this project, the Power Query Editor within Power BI is used to perform various data transformation tasks, such as:

* Data Cleaning: Remove unwanted columns, handle missing or null values, and correct data inconsistencies.

* Data Transformation: Filtering, merging, and aggregating datasets, as well as changing data types and formatting.

## Tools Used
* Power BI: A powerful business analytics tool that helps to visualize data, clean it, and perform various transformations.

* Power Query Editor: A tool within Power BI used for data preparation and transformation, allowing users to clean and structure data before analysis.

## Output
 The final output will be a clean and structured dataset ready for analysis and visualization within Power BI, allowing users to generate insights and business intelligence from the data.
